## 5) Sharing
We share data only with service providers that help us operate:

- **Email and communications** providers to send confirmations.  
- **Embedded and linked services** you choose to use, such as Instagram, Facebook, and Google Maps, which receive data directly from your browser under their policies.

- Booking records: kept as long as needed for scheduling, customer service, and legal obligations.

If our providers store data outside your region, we use providers that commit to appropriate transfer safeguards where required.
